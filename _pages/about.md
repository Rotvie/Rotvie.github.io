I’m an Electronic Engineer focused on AI, machine learning, and robotics. My background spans both academic research and industry, working on autonomous robotic systems and large-scale machine learning pipelines.

My experience includes computer vision and navigation for agricultural robots, as well as building scalable systems for deploying machine learning models into production. I enjoy taking ideas from research and turning them into practical tools and workflows.

I’m motivated by technology that solves real problems and creates meaningful impact. Feel free to explore my work or reach out if you’d like to collaborate.

**Interests:** Robotics · Computer Vision · Deep RL · NLP
