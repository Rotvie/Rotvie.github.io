I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Electronic Engineering from the Universidad Privada Antenor Orrego (UPAO) in Peru in 2022.

During my time at UPAO, I contributed to projects within the Multidisciplinary Research Laboratory, focusing on autonomous navigation for mobile robots in complex environments and the development of computer vision systems to address challenges in the agroindustry.

I am driven by the endless possibilities technology offers. I invite you to explore my website to learn more about my work or to get in touch regarding collaboration opportunities.

**Key Areas of Interest:** Robotics, Computer Vision, Deep Reinforcement Learning, Natural Language Processing.
